 1. Modify the Firm example from this chapter such that it accomplishes its polymorphism using an interface called Payable.
 2. Modify the Firm example from this chapter such that all employees can be given different vacation options depending on their classification. Provide a method called vacation that returns the number of vacation days a person has. Give all employees a standard number of vacation days (14), then override the method in the various employee classes as appropriate. Modify the driver program to demonstrate this new functionality.  
 3.  Implement the Speaker interface described in Section 10.3, and create three classes that implement Speaker in various ways. Create a driver class whose main method instantiates some of these objects and tests their abilities.  
 4.  Rewrite the Sorting class so that both sorting algorithms put the values in descending order. Create a driver class with a main method to exercise the modifications.
